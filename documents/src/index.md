# Parameter estimation for ordinary differential equations

In these notes I will demonstrate some techniques for estimating parameters and initial 
conditions for ordinary differential equations. The application will be the Droop-Grover 
model of phytoplankton growth on one limiting nutrient with growth rate determined by internal nutrient reserves.

Examples are broken into the following sections

* The differential equations and their numerical solution
* Parameter estimation from simulated data
* Observational data from lab cultures
* SciML optimization to estimate parameters and initial conditions
* Turing-MCMCChains methods to estimate distributions of parameters and predicted trajectories
